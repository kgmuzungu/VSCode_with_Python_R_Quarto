You can have multiple Python versions installed in parallel. On Windows machines Python can be installed in different locations, depending if it was installed via the app store or as an installable. Open e cmd.exe or powershell.exe and type python --version. You will get the Python interpreter version of the python.exe that is in the %PATH% variable. It can be handy to have the folders with python.exe in the PATH variable. Normally pip is installed with Python. pip is the python package installer. You can type pip --version on the command line. If you dont get a response than you might have to install pip separately.\nAlso install R, Quarto, Git and VSCode. The order does not matter\nThe paths of the executables of all should be in the PATH environment variable of Windows. echo %PATH% on cmd.exe. Or/and you should know the respective paths so we can add them to the VSCode extenstions manually."

Now we create a virtual Python environment in this folder. With Ctrl + shift + p open the VSCode command palette. Type “create” and you should see Python: Create Environment. VSCode will find a the python interpreter that is in %PATH% or you can enter a path to a different python.exe (different version). From now onward, if you use pip to install a python library, it will be installed locally in the ./.venv folder of your project. You should have a .venv folder in your project folder.\nWith Terminal –&gt; New Terminal open a new terminal window (basically a OS command line). Lets install the python library radian. radian. It makes the R console colorful and better readable. Open a terminal and pip install -U radian installs the required files. We need some more Python libraries. pip install pandas installs the pandas library. pip list lists all locally installed libraries and pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt creates a list with all installed libraries plus version numbers. A great interactive python console is ipython, pip install ipython. Other useful packages are plotnine, statsmodels, scipy."

You dont have to replace {workspaceFolder} with an explicit path). Set R: Bracketed Paste. And in the R debugger extension we need to set the the R interpreter path, R &gt; Rpath Windows to, e.g. C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-4.4.1\\bin\\x64\\R.exe.

Under ‘help pages’ click on ‘Install CRAN Package’ or on the plus sign next to it and install * httpg and * languageserver * renv\nAt this point we have a working quarto setup with a virtual Python environment and globally installed R packages. We can also setup a virtual R environment, (renv)[https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html], to keep R packages local in the project folder. Virtual environments allow different projects using different interpreters and package versions."

Also there is a misleading mistake in the how-to:\n\nBefore configuring the publishing action, it’s important that you run quarto publish gh-pages locally, once.
